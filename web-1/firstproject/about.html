    <h2>UGA History</h2>
<p>"Dr. Charles Herty was the first UGA football coach and he led the Bulldogs to a 1-1 record in 1892. In their first game, Georgia defeated Mercer 50-0 in Athens. Georgia met Auburn at Piedmont Park in Atlanta for their second and final game of 1892. Auburn defeated Georgia 10-0 and the “The Deep South’s Oldest Rivalry” was started.

Vince Dooley, Georgia’s winningest coach, led the Bulldogs to the 1980 National Championship and 6 SEC Championships. Dooley coached the Dawgs from 1964 to 1988 and his overall record was 201-77-10.

In 2001, Mark Richt took over the head coaching position at the University of Georgia and returned the Bulldogs to national prominence. In his 15 seasons as Head Coach, Mark Richt led the Dawgs to a 145-51 record (83-37 SEC), the 2002 and 2005 SEC Championships and nine bowl wins.

On Sunday, Nov. 29, 2015, Mark Richt was fired as the head coach of the Georgia Bulldogs. The Bulldogs went 9-3 in 2015, but lost big to Alabama and Florida and a close game at Tennessee after leading by 21.

Alabama defensive coordinator and UGA alum Kirby Smart was named the new head football coach on Dec. 6, 2015.

In his second season in Athens, Kirby Smart and the Bulldogs won the 2017 SEC Championship Game 28-7 over Auburn and won the College Football Semifinal at the Rose Bowl 54-48 in double-overtime over Oklahoma. Georgia advanced to the College Football National Championship, but fell to Alabama 26-23 in overtime."</p>

  <h2>The Georgia "G" Helmet <img src="assets/img/ghelmet.jpg" class="image-right" alt="old" width="140" height="90"/> </h2>
<p>
"In 1963 after becoming the Bulldogs' Head Football Coach, Vince Dooley redesigned the football uniform choosing a red helmet with a black "G" on a white background as the dominant feature of the new uniform for the 1964 season."</p>

<p>"He discussed with his staff that a forward-looking "G" would be an appropriate emblem for the helmet of the Georgia team. Dooley had just hired John Donaldson, former Georgia player from 1945 to 1948, as backfield coach. John was keen on the idea of a new image and volunteered his wife, Anne, who had a BFA in commercial art from UGA to design a logo for the new Georgia helmet with the general specifications Dooley had outlined. Dooley accepted Anne's original "G" which fit his vision for a forward look to Georgia's new emblem."</p>

<p>"Since the Georgia "G"- though different in design and color- was similar to Green Bay's "G", Coach Dooley thought it best to clear the use of Georgia's new emblem with the NFL team. Athletic Director Joel Eaves called for permission which was granted. However, since its inception in 1961, the Green Bay "G" has been redesigned several times and now looks like Georgia's original 1964 "G." Georgia is proud that the Packers apparently liked the special nuances of the Bulldogs' forward-looking "G."</p>

<p>"Georgia's oval "G", eventually replacing Georgia's old block "G" as the official UGA symbol, has stood the test of time. It made its first appearance in the opening game in 1964 and was an immediate hit with the Georgia fans, especially after Dooley's first three teams were so successful--highlighted by the 1966 SEC Championship."

          <h2>Uga</h2>
          <P>
"One of the best known mascots in the country, Uga is from a line owned by Frank W. (Sonny) Seiler of Savannah, GA. since 1956. The current line began with Uga I, a solid white English Bulldog who was the grandson of a former Georgia mascot who made the trip to the 1943 Rose Bowl. Perhaps the most famous Uga was Uga V who made appearances in the movie "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil". He also graced the cover of Sports Illustrated. Uga IV was the first mascot invited to the Downtown Athletic Club and was escorted through the banquet hall by the president of the Downtown Athletic Club and was photographed with Heisman Trophy winner Herschel Walker. He was also the only mascot to make it to the Final Four basketball tournament."</p>

          <h2>"Bulldogs"</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
"Many old-timers say Georgia acquired the nickname, Bulldogs, because of the strong ties with Yale whose nickname is Bulldogs. Georgia's first president, Abraham Baldwin, was a Yale man and the early buildings on campus were designed from blueprints of the same building at Yale. But on Nov. 3, 1920, Morgan Blake of the ATLANTA JOURNAL wrote about school nicknames and said "The Georgia Bulldogs" would sound good because there is a certain dignity about a bulldog, as well as ferocity." After a 0-0 tie with Virginia in Charlottesville on Nov. 6, 1920, ATLANTA CONSTITUTION writer Cliff Wheatley used the name "Bulldogs" in his story five times. The name has been used ever since."</p>
