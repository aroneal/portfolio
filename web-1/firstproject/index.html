 <h2>Cool facts about the Bulldogs</h2>

  <h3>Retired numbers</h3> 
  <p>Only four jerseys are retired in Bulldogs football lore — Walker’s 34, Sinkwich’s 21, Theron Sapp’s 40 and No. 62 from Charley Trippi. Trippi won the Maxwell Award in 1946 and was a consensus All-American that same season.</p>

  <h3>“Glory, Glory”</h3> <figcaption> Listen to the song Glory Glory. </figcaption><iframe width="300" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cIeZV8rESE0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="iframe-left"></iframe> 
  <p>Georgia’s fight song has been around more than a century and is sang to the tune of “The Battle Hymn for the Republic.” Hugh Hodgson composed its current form in 1915.</p>

 <h3>Heisman history</h3>
  <p>Georgia’s two Heisman winners, Frank Sinkwich and Herschel Walker, received the award 40 years apart and both of their teams won SEC championships. Sinkwich was responsible for 60 career touchdowns while Walker, in three seasons, managed to set the league’s all-time career rushing record which still stands today at 5,259 yards. Sinkwich was drafted No. 1 by the Detroit Lions in 1943.</p>

<h3>SEC Championship</h3>
  <p>Georgia’s won 12 conference titles, the last coming in 2005. The Bulldogs have appeared in the SEC Championship Game five times since its inception in 1992 and have two victories.</p>

<h3>Glenn Scobey Warner</h3>
<p> We all know him as ‘Pop’, the godfather of youth football and one of the early advocates of the forward pass in the 1900s. Warner won seven games Georgia’s head coach from 1895-96 and brought several innovative formations to football including the double and single wing. He was one of the game’s first coaches to draw up end-arounds and flea-flickers, using trick plays later in his career to thwart the competition. Warner was also credited with introducing shoulder and thigh pads during a dangerous era in the sport.
